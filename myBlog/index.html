        <h2>How did I start?</h2>

        <p class="border">So how did I get started with programming? Well it began when I was working in a fast food restaurant where I was bored and miserable trying to pay my way through university. </p>

        <p>I met a fellow team member who was a programmer but working part time to earn additional cash. He thought that it would be lucrative career choice to become a programmer but what attracted me to programming was actually creating things; putting my ideas into something tangible.</p>

        <p>Now the main problem was where to begin. There are so many languages out there that it is extremely difficult to get your head around and this was the main reason for my blog to help other people avoid the pitfalls I went through and help people achieve their dreams by bring their dreams to life or have a career change . I’m not an expert in everything but I will share the best websites, books and tools I used to get started.</p>

        <p><strong>So I hope you enjoy the journey.</strong></p>

        <h2>Time management</h2>

        <p class="border">Managing time is so important when you are trying to juggle so many things such as work, studying and learning a new skill.</p>

        <p>The best thing to do in order effectively use your time is to create a to- do list. The best thing that works for me is to do a weekly to do list on a Sunday evening and breaking that list into daily task. Most likely you won’t be able to complete every task but as you continue to create these lists you make realist task in a manageable time frame.</p>

        <p>As well even during that a certain day things inexpertly pop up such as you need to stay longer at work etc. The main thing is to evaluate your task for that day and ask yourself what one or two items in the list are going to achieve my personal goal. It is so easy to do task that are important but not going to take you anywhere. But by doing these things will help you not just with programming but anything in life.</p>

        <p><strong>Till next time.</strong></p>
